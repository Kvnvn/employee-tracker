## Employee tracking system

## Description 
This project shows how I created an interface using node,inquirer, and mySQl. This assignment focuses on making it easy for non-developers to view their company information stored in a database.


In employee tracker you start off with a list of commands that you are able to run.

After, it prompts user with which department they wanted to reach and on display will be the department and who is in that specific department.
